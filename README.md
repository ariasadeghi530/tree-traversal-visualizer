# Tree Traversal Visualizer

Welcome to the Tree Traversal Visualizer! I built this application because I am a visual learner, and I was not a fan of the other visualizers I had found. I hope you enjoy engaging with my visualization as much as I had creating it! 

## Traversal Algorithms

Depth First Search (DFS): Three types, Preorder, Inorder, Postorder. Pre(CLR) In(LCR) Post(LRC)

Breadth First Search (BFS): Level Order Traversal, visit nodes level by level and left to right at the same level
